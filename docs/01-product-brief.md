# Product Brief

## 1. What This Product Is

This is an Archetype-Based Learning Engine.

It trains users on granular conceptual skills ("archetypes") through repeated problem attempts and rating updates.

The system focuses on:

- Micro-skill identification
- Explicit skill tracking
- Difficulty-aligned practice
- Data-driven skill progression

This is not a content platform.
It is not a social network.
It is not a general LMS.

It is a skill calibration engine.

## 2. Target User

The target user is:

- A serious learner
- Someone who values structured skill progression
- Someone who prefers granular feedback over passive consumption
- Someone willing to practice repeatedly

This product does not target casual scrollers.

## 3. Core Loop

The core loop is:

1. Select archetype.
2. Serve problem near user skill rating.
3. User submits attempt.
4. Attempt is recorded (append-only).
5. Skill rating is updated.
6. Next problem adapts to updated rating.

Everything in the system must reinforce this loop.

If a feature does not strengthen this loop, it is unnecessary.

## 4. Core Data Principles

- Attempts are source of truth.
- Skill ratings are derived state.
- Problems belong to archetypes.
- Skill progression must be explainable.
- Rating logic must be deterministic and testable.

---

## 5. What This Product Is Not

This system is not:

- A content discovery platform
- A gamified social leaderboard app
- An AI chatbot tutor
- A note-taking tool
- A general education marketplace

Those may exist elsewhere.
They do not exist here.

## 6. Success Criteria

The product is successful when:

- Skill ratings reflect actual user performance.
- The system adapts difficulty reliably.
- Architecture remains simple.
- Data remains consistent.
- The core loop stays intact as complexity grows.
